Quick Escape Artist — Privacy Policy


Last updated: August 14, 2025


Summary
- This app stores user-created contacts, message templates, and scheduled alarms locally on your device.
- The app uses local notifications, device audio and vibration for its features.
- No data is transmitted to external servers by the app. There are no logins, analytics, or remote backups implemented.


What we collect
- Data you enter manually: custom contact names/relationship labels, custom message templates, and scheduled alarm metadata.
- Local runtime state such as active scheduled alarms stored in app local storage.


How we use data
- All data is stored locally to provide core functionality: generating fake calls/texts and scheduling alarms.
- Notifications are scheduled and triggered locally; audio and vibration are used on-device.


Third parties
- The app uses Expo libraries (for notifications and audio) but does not send user data to third-party servers.
- No analytics, crash-reporting, or advertising SDKs are included.


Data sharing
- We do not share, sell, or transmit user data to external parties.


Storage & deletion
- Data is stored on the device. To remove all personal data, uninstall the app or use the app Settings (delete custom contacts/messages and clear scheduled alarms) — see Settings → Clear data.


Permissions
- Notifications: required for scheduled alarms. The app will request notification permission when needed.
- Audio/vibration: used locally to play ringtones and vibrate the device.
- The app does not request contacts/address-book access.


Changes
- If the app behavior changes (e.g., introducing backups, analytics, or server sync), this policy will be updated and users will be informed.
